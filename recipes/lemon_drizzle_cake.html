    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
 
    <ul>
        <li>225g self-raising flour</li>
        <li>175g caster sugar (+75g for the drizzle)</li>
        <li>175g unsalted butter (room temperature)</li>
        <li>3 medium eggs</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons full-fat milk</li>
        <li>Zest and juice from 2 large lemons</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking powder</li>
    </ul>
    
       
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Beat the butter and sugar together using a hand mixer.</li>
        <li>Add the eggs one by one mixing well after each addition.</li>
        <li>Sift in the flour, baking powder, add the lemon zest and milk, and mix again to a smooth, creamy consistency.</li>
        <li>Flour and grease a round cake tin (mine is a 19x7 cm with loose base), then spread the batter evenly.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven on the middle rack at 180 degrees C (350 degrees F) for 35-40 minutes, keeping an eye on it- the cake is done when the top is golden and a skewer inserted in the middle comes out clean.</li>
        <li>To make the syrup, mix the lemon juice with 75 g of sugar.</li>
        <li>Once the cake is out of the oven, remove it from the tin, pour over the lemon syrup, then leave it to cool down completely. </li>
    </ol>
